        <h2>MATO Services</h2>

        <p class="intro-text">
            As any experienced general contractor or home builder can attest, successful subcontractors,
            like those who specialize in the installation of wheelchair lifts and home elevators,
            must excel at service and attention to detail. Contractors and builders require timely
            information and instruction so that when it is time for the lift or elevator to be installed,
            it can be accomplished safely and efficiently.
        </p>

        <p class="intro-text">
            Installations of lifts and elevators require the installer to give clear and detailed
            instructions to ensure the area is properly prepared. These instructions are delivered
            in the form of detailed, siteâ€“specific drawings prepared by Home Lift. These drawings
            indicate the job name, exactly what dimensions are required, as well as the location of
            hoistway openings and power requirements. Drawings also list the product specifications
            and the chosen options.

            <h2>Scheduling an Installation:</h2>
            <p>Wheelchair lifts, Home Elevators and LULA Elevators are all manufactured to order. They are designed to
                fit the conditions on the job site and conform to specifications. This means that contractors wishing to
                include lifts and elevators on their projects should plan ahead. The following is intended as a rough
                estimate of typical lead times associated with the various stages of a lift or elevator project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first step is to contact us. We will help to determine how your elevator needs to be configured.
                </li>
                <li>Your representative submits an order to Home Lift for your elevator or lift. Your specific project
                    will be assigned a serial number and it will be designed and configured as per instructions. Allow
                    about 5-7 working days for Home Lift to issue detailed, site-specific drawings to your
                    representative.</li>
                <li>If any changes are required, they must be made at this time. Drawings are revised until they show
                    exactly what is desired. Detailed measurements obtained from actual site conditions are required.
                </li>
                <li>Once the drawings are accurate, they are approved by Home Lift representative and Home Lift is
                    notified in writing. A target ship date is assigned. Typically, production lead times vary from 6-10
                    weeks.</li>
                <li>After the lift or elevator has been manufactured, it is shipped to your location. Allow about 1
                    week.</li>
                <li>Once the equipment arrives, your local representatives must then schedule the installation. Allow
                    2-3 weeks.</li>
                <li>The time needed for the installation itself depends on the type of equipment being installed and the
                    layout of the jobsite. Many times, home elevator, LULA elevator and Genesis shaftway vertical lift
                    installations will be done in two stages. The General Contractor will be required to complete some
                    finish work around door entrances prior to the second stage. Stage completion usually takes from 3-5
                    working days. Genesis Enclosure vertical lifts, Genesis Opals and all inclined platform lift
                    installations are normally completed in a single stage. </li>
                <li>Typically, lifts and elevators installed in commercial buildings are required to be inspected and
                    permitted by local elevator inspectors. In some jurisdictions, residential installations also
                    require inspections and permits. The time it takes to schedule and perform an inspection varies
                    widely. Usually, this takes 2-3 weeks to accomplish.</li>
                <li>The final stage of installation is a training and turnover session. Your local Home Lift
                    representative will show you how to operate the lift or elevator, what to do in case of emergency
                    and how to arrange for regular maintenance and service . Ask about extending your warranty to
                    include 7 years of coverage â€“ the best warranty available in the industry.</li>
